# Universal Code Grep

Universal Code Grep (ucg) is another [Ack](http://beyondgrep.com/) clone.  It is a grep-like tool specialized for searching large bodies of source code.

Ucg is written in C++ and takes advantage of the newer (C++14) facilities of the language to reduce reliance on non-standard libraries, increase portability, and increase scanning speed.
