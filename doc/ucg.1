.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ucg
(UniversalCodeGrep) is an extremely fast grep-like 
tool specialized for searching large bodies of source code.
It is intended to be largely command-line compatible with ack,
to some extent with ag, and - where appropriate - with
.BR grep (1).
Search patterns are specified as
.BR pcre (3)
regular expressions.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS Searching:
.TP
.B \-\-[no]smart\-case
Ignore case if 
.I PATTERN
is all lowercase (default: enabled).
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-ignore\-case
Ignore case distinctions in
.I PATTERN
.TP
.B \-Q, \-\-literal
Treat all characters in
.I PATTERN
as literal.
.TP
.B \-w, \-\-word\-regexp
\fIPATTERN\fR
Must match a complete word.
.SS Search Output:
.TP
.B \-\-column
Print column of first match after line number.
.TP
.B \-\-nocolumn
Don't print column of first match (default).
.SS "File presentation:"
.TP
.B \-\-color, \-\-colour
Render the output with ANSI color codes.
.TP
.B \-\-nocolor, \-\-nocolour
Render the output without ANSI color codes.
.SS "File/directory inclusion/exclusion:"
.TP
\fB\-\-[no]ignore\-dir\fR=\fINAME\fR, \fB\-\-[no]ignore\-directory=\fINAME\fR
[Do not] exclude directories with \fINAME\fR.
.TP
.B \-\-exclude=GLOB, \-\-ignore=GLOB
Files matching GLOB will be ignored.
.TP
.B \-\-ignore\-file=FILTER:FILTERARGS
Files matching FILTER:FILTERARGS
(e.g. ext:txt,cpp) will be ignored.
.TP
.B \-\-include=GLOB
Only files matching GLOB will be searched.
.TP
.B \-k, \-\-known\-types
Only search in files of recognized types (default: on).
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-no\-recurse
Do not recurse into subdirectories.
.TP
.B \-r, \-R , \-\-recurse
Recurse into subdirectories (default: on).
.TP
.B \-\-type=[no]TYPE
Include only [exclude all] TYPE files.
Types may also be specified as \-\-[no]TYPE.
.SS File type specifications:
.TP
.B \-\-type\-add=TYPE:FILTER:FILTERARGS
Files FILTERed with the given FILTERARGS are treated as
belonging to type TYPE. Any existing definition of type
TYPE is appended to.
.TP
.B \-\-type\-del=TYPE
Remove any existing definition of type TYPE.
.TP
.B \-\-type\-set=\fITYPE:FILTER:FILTERARGS\fR
Files FILTERed with the given FILTERARGS are treated as
belonging to type TYPE. Any existing definition of type
TYPE is replaced.
.SS Performance tuning:
.TP
.B \-\-dirjobs=\fINUM_JOBS\fR
Number of directory traversal jobs (std::thread<>s)
to use.
.TP
.B \-j, \-\-jobs=\fINUM_JOBS\fR
Number of scanner jobs (std::thread<>s) to use.
.SS Miscellaneous:
.TP
.B \-\-noenv
Ignore
.B .ucgrc
files.
.SS Informational options:
.TP
.B \-?, \-\-help
Print a list of options.
.TP
.B \-\-help\-types, \-\-list\-file\-types
Print a list of supported file types.
.TP
.B \-\-usage
Print a brief usage message.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Print program version.
.PP
Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also
mandatory or optional for any corresponding short options.
.SH EXIT STATUS
Exit status is 0 if any matches were found, 1 if no matches,
2 or greater on error.
.SH FILES
.B ucg
supports configuration files with the name
.B .ucgrc
in which command-line options can be stored on a per-user
and per-directory-hierarchy basis.
.SS Format:
.B .ucgrc
files are text files with a simple format. Each line of text 
can be either:
.IP
A single-line comment. The line must start with a # and the
comment continues for the rest of the line.
.IP
A command-line parameter. This must be exactly as if it was
given on the command line.
.SS Location and Read Order:
When
.B ucg
is invoked, it looks for command-line options from
the following locations in the following order:
.IP
1. The 
.B .ucgrc
file in the user's $HOME directory, if any.
.IP
2. The first
.B .ucgrc
file found, if any, by walking up the component directories
of the current working directory. This traversal stops at either
the user's $HOME directory or the root directory. This is the
project config file, and is intended to live in the top-level
directory of a project directory hierarchy.
.IP
3. The command line itself.
.PP
Options read later will override earlier options.
.SS User-Defined File Types:
.B ucg
supports user-defined file types with the
.PP
\-\-type\-set=TYPE:FILTER:FILTERARGS and
.PP
\-\-type\-add=TYPE:FILTER:FILTERARGS command-line options.
.PP
Three FILTERs are currently supported:
.IP
ext (extension list)
.IP
is (literal filename)
.IP
glob (glob pattern)
.IP
.SS Extension List Filter
.IP
The extension list filter allows you to specify a comma-separated
list of file extensions which are to be considered as belonging to
file type TYPE.
.IP
Example: \-\-type\-set=type1:ext:abc,xqz,def
.SS Literal Filename Filter
.IP
The literal filename filter simply specifies a single literal
filename which is to be considered as belonging to file type TYPE.
.IP
Example: \-\-type\-add=autoconf:is:configure.ac
.SS Glob filter
.IP
The glob filter allows you to specify a glob pattern to match
against filenames. If the glob matches, the file is considered
as belonging to the file type TYPE.
.IP
Example: \-\-type\-set=mk:glob:?akefile*
